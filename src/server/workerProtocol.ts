/**
 * Main ↔ worker protocol. The main thread constructs OSC packets
 * (`OSC.Message` / `OSC.Bundle`) locally, encodes them to bytes via
 * `@sc-app/server-commands`, and posts the bytes over to the worker.
 * The worker forwards bytes to the WebSocket bridge and decodes
 * inbound bytes back into plain `{ address, args }` POJOs for the
 * main thread to consume.
 *
 * Why POJOs on the return path: `postMessage` uses structured-clone,
 * which strips class prototypes. `OSC.Message` instances arrive on
 * the main thread as bare `{ address, args, types }` objects without
 * methods. We formalise that shape here rather than pretending it's
 * still an `OSC.Message`.
 *
 * Phase 17 unified the subscription protocol: one
 * `BufferSubscription` covers what used to be split into
 * `ScopeSubscription` + `RecordingSubscription`. The worker keeps
 * one entry per `bufferId`, fans /b_setn replies back as
 * `bufferChunk` events, and applies the offset-keyed pending +
 * tick-ordered reorder buffer + retry policy uniformly. WAV writing
 * and gap-sidecar accounting moved to main thread (in
 * `RecordingController`); the worker is now subscription-agnostic.
