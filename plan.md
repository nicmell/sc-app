# SCSynth Oscilloscope & Recorder — Plan

Forward-looking spec. Pending phases live here in detail (open
questions, file maps, acceptance criteria). When a phase ships, it
moves to [`docs/history.md`](./docs/history.md).

Project overview, architecture diagram, architectural principles,
audio config schema, file layout, workspace packages, and the
chunkSize × sampleRate practical table all live in
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — don't duplicate them here.

**No phase currently in flight.** Phases 0–30 are in
[`docs/history.md`](./docs/history.md). The next planned
piece of work picks from the [Future Improvements](#future-improvements)
list below — none is blocked by anything currently shipped,
so promotion to a numbered phase is on demand.

## Open Points

1. **Reply correlation for `/b_getn`.** scsynth matches replies by
   bufnum, not by explicit request id. The "one read in flight per
   bufnum per offset" invariant is what makes it safe; the worker
   enforces it via `pendingByOffset`. Dev-only assertion
   recommended.
2. **Parent group ID derivation.** `clientId × 100`, falling back
   to `100` when scsynth assigns `clientId = 0`. The fallback
   warns in the debug log. Promotion to a configurable allocator
   has not been needed.
3. **Clock bus ID.** Allocated from `ids.bus` starting at 32 to
   skip hardware-reserved buses. Confirm against scsynth boot
   config if a deployment uses a non-default
   `numAudioBusChannels`.
4. **Phase boundary parity.** `completedHalf = tickIndex % 2` (see
   Phase 5 / 8 gotchas in `docs/history.md`). The original plan had
   it inverted; verified empirically.
5. **`BufWr` is zero-order-hold.** Does not anti-alias on
   decimation. After Phase 13's revert to `decimation = 1` this
   is no longer an issue — every audio frame is written. If a
   future feature reintroduces decimation, plan for a proper
   anti-aliased path.
6. **Recording memory ceiling.** Float32 stereo at 48 kHz =
   ~23 MB/min. Practical comfortable ceiling ~10–15 min before
   RAM pressure. Streaming-to-disk (Future Improvement #2)
   addresses this.
7. **WAV 4 GB header limit.** Float32 stereo at 48 kHz → ~3h45m
   max file size in the WAV header. Above the RAM ceiling, so not
   binding in practice. RF64 deferred.
8. **Reconnection.** Out of scope. App expects manual reload on
   WS loss (the runtime error modal facilitates that). Future
   Improvement #3.
9. **Ordering constraints within parent group.** Clock at head;
   everything else `AddToTail`; producers must be created before
   consumers that read their buses. Documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
10. **Parent group placement at root.** `AddToTail` of the root
    group is now load-bearing (Phase 26 deployments share scsynth
    with sclang+SuperDirt). Documented in `CLAUDE.md` gotchas
    and at the constructor of `GroupController`.

## Future Improvements

Follow-on phases, in rough order of value / effort ratio. None are
blocked by anything currently shipped.

### 1. Spectral scope (FFT view)

Add a `compileFFTScopeSynthDef` that runs `FFT.kr` on the input
bus into a 1024-bin buffer (one FFT every tick — natural cadence
given `samplesPerTick = 1024`). Worker reads the buffer the same
way as a time-domain scope; main thread renders log-magnitude
bars or a filled spectrogram. Post-Phase-16, this is "add a
consumer that subscribes to a `BufferController`" — no new synth
or buffer.

**Cost:** ~1 day. Most of the work is the renderer.

### 4. Tauri-managed scsynth lifecycle

Today scsynth must be running before the user connects. In Tauri
builds we could spawn it as a managed sidecar — Tauri sets the
binary path, audio device, sample rate; we read stdout for the
`SuperCollider 3 server ready` banner; we kill cleanly on exit.

**Cost:** ~½ day. Mostly Tauri-side glue (`tauri.conf.json`
sidecar config + a Rust command wrapper). Serve / browser builds
keep "bring your own scsynth" semantics.

### 5. Test coverage for `src/`

The two workspace packages have parity tests. The app itself has
zero. The pieces that absorbed real debugging cycles are the ones
worth pinning:

- `EnvelopeBuffer` — append a known signal, snapshot, verify
  min/max columns.
- `WavMemoryWriter` — append known frames, finalise, parse the
  resulting WAV header.
- Worker recording dispatch (post-buffer-refactor, on main) —
  mock the chunk stream, fire a sequence of tick events with a
  dropped reply, assert reorder + gap accounting.
- `BufferManager` — refcount semantics under interleaved
  acquire/release.
- `SequencerController` (post-Phase-27) — feed a fake clock,
  assert the schedule queue against expected `dirtClient.play`
  calls.

Vitest is already set up in workspace packages.

**Cost:** ~1 day.

### 6. Persistent UI settings

`localStorage` per-session: last-used scsynth address (already
done), preferred chunkSize, channel count, recording bus, window
size, sequencer pattern bank (lands in Phase 27c).

**Cost:** ~½ day.

### 7. Bus naming / labelling

A small label registry — "synth out", "FX return", "monitor mix"
— would let recordings + scopes show meaningful names instead of
ad-hoc memorisation. The bus number stays the source of truth;
the label is purely UI.

**Cost:** ~½ day.

### 8. Per-scope/recording independent pause

Today `/n_run 0` on the parent group freezes everything.
Sometimes you want to pause one scope while keeping the rest
running. Implementable as `/n_run 0 nodeId` on the specific
synth, with state tracked per-controller.

**Cost:** ~½ day.
